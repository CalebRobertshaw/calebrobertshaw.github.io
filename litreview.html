    <h3>Literature Review:</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In modern society. Our mobile devices, our laptops, our smartphones have all become a massive part of our daily life routines. We are amazed every year with all the new technologies that companies release with even more performant devices than what we already have. Even though these advancements are extraordinary, they still prove to be a big issue for the security protocols in many companies due to ease of access from an unknown attacker. In this review we will be discussing some of the problems in some company’s security protocols and how to prevent most attackers from stealing valuable information. </p>
    <h2>Bring Your Own Device</h2>
    <p>With modern day technology we are never far from being able to access the internet and important documents with only our mobile phones at any point in time of the day. However, what most companies persist to neglect is the dangers of allowing their employees to bring in their own personal devices in order to view, create or modify important documents that could cause serious damage to the company if these documents were to be leaked into the public world wide web. In the early 2000s, BlackBerry released their first smartphone which caught the attention from companies for their constant connectivity and the possibility to have remote access to their emails and company calendars. Industries saw the paybacks from these devices and began providing smartphones which came with network access to many of their employees. In 2009, Intel, acknowledged the advancements towards BYOD ( Bring Your Own Device ) when employees sought to use their personal every day devices in their working office. Instead of overlooking the potential risks, Intel accepted for personal devices to be used but they decided to put in place an operational policy for these personal devices.</p>
    <h2>Vulnerabilities With BYOD</h2>
    <p>While using a personal device for professional reasons there comes multiple dangers and vulnerabilities that could cause severe damages to a company. From an obvious perspective, any user without the appropriate permission could access any of the company’s files while using an employee’s device. An employee could not encrypt the documents correctly, so then if the device is stolen or being attacked via the world wide web, the attacker would have no problem retrieving these files and leaking them onto the open market which could collapse the company.
    There is possibility that an employee could catch a malware on their device seeing that people tend to take less care of their own devices other than their company devices. A malware could cause serious issues for the device for the many types of malicious software ( malware ), depending on the software’s function they contains various name ( Spyware, Virus, Surveillance Malware, Trojan, etc.. ). Even with the many ways of preventing your device from these devices (AntiVirus,MalwareByte,etc... ). A big part of the population doesn’t know how to successfully fully protect their devices. </p>
    <h2>Social Engineering And System Security</h2>
    <p>There is also issues with social engineering and system security, many employees will use the same device for their professional and personal emails, which can lead into other unknown attackers to data mine. Data mining is when an attacker collects data on the victim by collecting information that the victim has exposed about themselves online. From this, the attacker can get hold of private information like phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, friends of the victim, etc. Once the attackers have hold of this information they can use a method called Spear-Phising, which includes the attackers sending a composed phising message to the victim that looks like it was sent from the victims friend/colleague. </p>
    <h2>Methods Preventing Most Cyber Attacks</h2>
    <p>There is no way to secure any device completely and a device can only do so much to prevent an attack from happening, but there are ways to protect a device from most attacks. With the way technology is advancing it is  going to be very difficult to stay on top of your security systems but they’re methods that allow use to stop people from getting valuable information. First and for most, the most important software on a device is the AntiVirus. A AntiVirus is a must have for your device to prevent any viruses from infecting your device but that’s not everything you need to do to protect your device. A employee should now the difference between professional and personal, he shouldn’t let anybody apart from themselves and colleagues with the appropriate permission to use the device. An employee should be careful with what they post onto the world wide web. Be careful with what you upload onto the world wide web, most humans neglect the fact that posting personal information online could cause serious difficulties for later in life. Attackers could use this information to steal your identity and then leak valuable information. A user should keep their device up to date, an out of date software could cause a vulnerability with the program or with the company’s system which could cause a gap in the security allowing attackers to attempt an attack. </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>It is abundantly clear that technology is moving too fast for use as humans to keep on top of and to stay protected from all the new types of malicious software that are being developed every day. But studies show that they’re still ways to prevent most attacks. If an employee wishes to use their own device in the office, they must go know the dangers of the situation and learn how to prevent from any attack. A company must have an agreement with the employee which would make him take more care of the device and to be more careful with the information that he is taking home daily.</p>
